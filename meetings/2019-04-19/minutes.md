## Agenda

## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **benchmarking-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* Welcome to Gabriel and Octavian who have been working with Uttam and who will be helping to maintain DC-EIS and partipating in the WG.  Uttam is getting pulled in a few different directions.  Still working on Node.js but more on the optimization as opposed to the benchmarks.

### nodejs/benchmarking

* Investigate the time taken, and number of benchmarks in core [#225](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/225)
  * Michael, have not been able to catch up with Gareth.
  * Michael, close this issue and open a new one to cover the investigation that we want to do
  * Uttam, want to identify the smaller subset that we can use to run/capture nightly.
  * Discussion back and forth on scope/what we want to capture/run.
  * Maybe start with running once/month?
  * Gabriel and Octavian are going to review and write a proposal with next steps.

* Update charts on benchmarking.nodejs.org for 12.x [265](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/265)

* Uttam, require benchmark
  * Still cannot recreate 
  * Proposal to split out to 2 js files and run separately.
