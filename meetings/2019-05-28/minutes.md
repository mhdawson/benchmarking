* Investigate the time taken, and number of benchmarks in core [#225](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/225)
  * Octavian starting to look at this.
  * Michael, PR - in core which looks to remove benchmarks good for this
    team to comment there.
  * Uttam, notice there is a lot of variation in the buffer benchmarks, only way to get consistent
    results was to taskset to 1 core.
  * Gabriel/Octavian will discuss how they might push this forward.
